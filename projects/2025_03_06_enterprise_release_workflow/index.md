# Enterprise Release Workflow Enhancement

## Project Name
Enterprise-Grade Release Pipeline Implementation

## Project Rules and Conventions

### AWS Requirements
- AWS Profile: `gemini-dev-v2`
- CDK Context: `--context env=dev --context dev-account=017820663466`

### Quality Standards
- All code changes must pass linting, formatting, type checking, and tests
- Zero tolerance for failing tests - no exceptions
- All CDK infrastructure must synthesize without errors
- Comprehensive documentation for all configurations

### Workflow Standards
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Implement proper secret management
- Use reusable workflows where appropriate
- Maintain backward compatibility
- All external tools must be optional with proper skip logic

## Project Overview

This project evaluates and enhances the `.github/workflows/release.yml` file to meet enterprise production standards. The release workflow is responsible for versioning, tagging, and creating releases - NOT deployments.

## Current State Analysis

The existing release workflow provides basic functionality but lacks several critical enterprise features:

### Strengths
- Uses workflow_call for reusability
- Includes quality checks (delegated to quality.yml)
- Supports multiple environments
- Has version management with standard-version
- Includes basic Jira/GitHub integration

### Identified Gaps
1. **Version Management**
   - No artifact signing/attestation
   - Limited version conflict resolution
   - No automatic changelog generation beyond standard-version
   - Missing release notes templates

2. **Reliability & Resilience**
   - No retry mechanisms for critical steps (git operations, API calls)
   - Limited error handling
   - No validation of release artifacts
   - Missing pre-release checks

3. **Observability**
   - No structured logging for release events
   - Missing metrics collection for release success/failure
   - Limited audit trail for releases
   - No release performance tracking

4. **Enterprise Features**
   - No release signing/attestation
   - Missing release approval gates
   - No release artifact validation
   - Limited release metadata management

## Implementation Phases

### [Phase 1: Enhanced Version Management](./phase-1.md)
Implement better version conflict resolution, release templates, and artifact management for the release process.

### [Phase 2: Reliability & Error Handling](./phase-2.md)
Add retry mechanisms for git operations and API calls, proper error handling, and release validation.

### [Phase 3: Release Observability](./phase-3.md)
Implement structured logging for releases, metrics collection, and comprehensive audit trails.

### [Phase 4: Enterprise Release Features](./phase-4.md)
Add release signing, approval workflows, artifact attestation, and advanced release management.

### [Phase 5: Testing & Documentation](./phase-5.md)
Create comprehensive tests for the release workflow, documentation, and migration guides.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Robust version management implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for all release operations
- [ ] Full release observability integrated
- [ ] Enterprise release features functional
- [ ] Complete test coverage for release scenarios
- [ ] Documentation approved by stakeholders

## Timeline

Estimated completion: 1-2 weeks with proper testing and validation
