# Task ID: 22
# Title: Update Setup Script to Add Task Master AI Files to .gitignore
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the setup script to automatically add Task Master AI configuration and task files to the project's .gitignore file during installation, preventing sensitive or user-specific files from being committed to version control.
# Details:
The implementation should:

1. Update the setup script to include a function that handles .gitignore modifications
2. When Task Master AI is installed, the script should:
   - Check if a .gitignore file exists in the project root
   - Create a new .gitignore file if one doesn't exist
   - Add the following patterns if they don't already exist:
     * .taskmasterconfig
     * tasks/*.txt
     * tasks/task_*.txt
3. Implement pattern checking to prevent duplicate entries
4. Use appropriate file handling techniques to:
   - Read the existing .gitignore content
   - Check for existing patterns
   - Append new patterns only when needed
   - Write back to the file
5. Add appropriate logging to inform the user about the changes made
6. Handle potential errors gracefully (file permissions, etc.)
7. Document the behavior in the setup script's help text and README
8. Ensure this functionality runs during initial installation and can be triggered separately during updates

This feature helps maintain a clean repository by preventing user-specific task files and configuration from being committed, while still allowing the core functionality to be version controlled.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify:

1. **New Installation Test**:
   - Run the setup script in a fresh project without a .gitignore
   - Verify a .gitignore file is created with the correct patterns

2. **Existing .gitignore Test**:
   - Create a test project with an existing .gitignore containing some patterns
   - Run the setup script
   - Verify the Task Master AI patterns are added without disturbing existing content

3. **Duplicate Prevention Test**:
   - Create a test project with a .gitignore that already contains some of the Task Master AI patterns
   - Run the setup script
   - Verify no duplicates are created and all required patterns exist

4. **File Permission Test**:
   - Create a read-only .gitignore file
   - Run the setup script
   - Verify appropriate error handling and user feedback

5. **Integration Test**:
   - After installation, create some task files in the tasks/ directory
   - Run git status
   - Verify the task files are ignored by git

6. **Manual Verification**:
   - Review the modified setup script code for proper error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure the implementation follows best practices for file manipulation

Document all test cases and results to confirm the feature works as expected across different scenarios.
