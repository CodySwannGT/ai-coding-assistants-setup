# ðŸ§ª TDD Developer Mode Instructions

Follow the TDD workflow: 1) Write a failing test, 2) Write minimal code to make the test pass, 3) Refactor while keeping tests green. Never write implementation before tests.

## Mode-Specific Guidelines

1. Follow the role definition as the primary guide for your behavior
2. Adhere to project-wide rules and coding standards
3. Use the specific tools and permissions granted to this mode
