# Phase 1: Design and Architecture

## Objective
Design a flexible, reusable k6 load testing workflow that can be called after deployment by any customer-specific deploy action. Define the workflow interface, integration patterns, and architecture.

## Technical Specifications

### Workflow Interface Design
```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Target environment to test'
        required: true
        type: string
      test_scenario:
        description: 'Test scenario to run (smoke, load, stress, spike, soak)'
        required: false
        type: string
        default: 'smoke'
      base_url:
        description: 'Base URL of the application to test'
        required: true
        type: string
      k6_version:
        description: 'k6 version to use'
        required: false
        type: string
        default: 'latest'
      test_duration:
        description: 'Override test duration (e.g., 5m, 1h)'
        required: false
        type: string
      virtual_users:
        description: 'Override number of virtual users'
        required: false
        type: number
      thresholds_config:
        description: 'Path to custom thresholds configuration'
        required: false
        type: string
      test_script:
        description: 'Path to custom k6 test script'
        required: false
        type: string
        default: '.github/k6/default-test.js'
      fail_on_threshold:
        description: 'Fail workflow if thresholds are not met'
        required: false
        type: boolean
        default: true
      upload_results:
        description: 'Upload test results as artifacts'
        required: false
        type: boolean
        default: true
      cloud_run:
        description: 'Run tests on k6 Cloud (requires K6_CLOUD_TOKEN secret)'
        required: false
        type: boolean
        default: false
    outputs:
      test_passed:
        description: 'Whether the test passed all thresholds'
        value: ${{ jobs.k6_test.outputs.passed }}
      results_url:
        description: 'URL to test results (if uploaded)'
        value: ${{ jobs.k6_test.outputs.results_url }}
      summary:
        description: 'Test execution summary'
        value: ${{ jobs.k6_test.outputs.summary }}
    secrets:
      K6_CLOUD_TOKEN:
        required: false
        description: 'k6 Cloud API token for cloud runs'
      CUSTOM_HEADERS:
        required: false
        description: 'Custom headers for authenticated endpoints (JSON format)'
```

### Integration Pattern
```yaml
# Example customer deploy workflow
jobs:
  release:
    uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/release.yml@main
    with:
      environment: staging
  
  deploy:
    needs: release
    # ... customer-specific deployment steps ...
  
  load_test:
    needs: deploy
    uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/k6-load-test.yml@main
    with:
      environment: staging
      test_scenario: smoke
      base_url: ${{ needs.deploy.outputs.app_url }}
    secrets: inherit
```

## Tasks

- [ ] Research k6 GitHub Action best practices and existing implementations
- [ ] Define workflow inputs that cover common use cases
- [ ] Design output structure for easy integration
- [ ] Plan test scenario configurations (smoke, load, stress, spike, soak)
- [ ] Design threshold configuration schema
- [ ] Plan results storage and reporting strategy
- [ ] Define security requirements for API testing
- [ ] Create workflow skeleton with proper structure

## Documentation
- Document each input parameter with examples
- Create integration pattern examples
- Define test scenario characteristics
- Document threshold configuration options

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete workflow interface specification
- Clear integration patterns documented
- Test scenario definitions
- Security considerations addressed
- Workflow skeleton created in `.github/workflows/k6-load-test.yml`

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] All inputs have clear descriptions and defaults where appropriate
- [ ] Integration pattern works with existing release.yml structure
- [ ] Security considerations documented
- [ ] Workflow passes GitHub Actions validation
