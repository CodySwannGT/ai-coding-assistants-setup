## Security Scanning

This project implements comprehensive security scanning through automated workflows:

### AI-Powered Security Analysis
- **Claude Security Scan**: AI-powered vulnerability detection (non-blocking)
- Identifies potential security issues with contextual understanding

### Traditional Security Tools
- **SonarCloud**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitGuardian**: Secret detection in code and git history
- **npm audit**: Basic dependency vulnerability checks
- **FOSSA**: License compliance verification

### Security Workflow

All pull requests and commits to protected branches automatically trigger:
1. Dependency vulnerability scanning
2. Static code analysis for security issues
3. Secret detection across the codebase
4. License compliance checking
5. AI-powered security review

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue
Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report Privately
Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing: [security@your-domain.com]

Include the following information:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Target**: Based on severity
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project:

### Code Security
- Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review dependency licenses before adding
- Audit dependencies regularly using automated tools
- Pin dependency versions in production

### Development Workflow
1. Enable pre-commit hooks for secret scanning
2. Run security scans locally before pushing
3. Review security scan results in CI/CD
4. Address security findings before merging

## Security Tools Configuration

### Local Development
```bash
# Install security tools
npm install --save-dev snyk

# Run security audit
npm audit
snyk test

# Enable pre-commit hooks
npx husky install
```

### CI/CD Integration
Security scanning is automatically configured in `.github/workflows/quality.yml`. 

To enable additional security tools, add the following secrets:
- `SONAR_TOKEN`: For SonarCloud SAST
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: For Snyk dependency scanning
- `GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY`: For secret detection
- `FOSSA_API_KEY`: For license compliance

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Scope
This policy applies to vulnerabilities in:
- The core codebase
- Dependencies managed by this project
- Configuration templates and examples
- Documentation that could lead to security issues

### Out of Scope
- Vulnerabilities in external services
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues

### Safe Harbor
We support responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Act in good faith
- Do not access or modify user data
- Do not disrupt our services
- Provide adequate time for patching

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as:
- **Patches**: For critical vulnerabilities
- **Minor versions**: For high/medium vulnerabilities
- **Advisory notices**: For low-risk issues
