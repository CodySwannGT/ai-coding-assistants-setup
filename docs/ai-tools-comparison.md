## When to Use Each Tool

### Claude Code
Claude Code excels at:
- **Complex understanding** of your entire codebase
- **Conversations about code** with natural language explanations
- **Implementing larger features** that require deeper context
- **Debugging complex issues** with step-by-step reasoning
- **Refactoring and restructuring** code with project-wide understanding
- **Documentation generation** with comprehensive context
- **MCP tool integration** for external data access and operations

Choose Claude Code when you need deeper understanding and reasoning about your code, or when you want to have a conversation about complex programming concepts.

### Roo Code
Roo Code is ideal for:
- **Structured development** with specific rules and guidelines
- **Security-sensitive coding** with strong permission controls
- **Specialized coding roles** using different modes (Architect, TDD Developer, etc.)
- **Rule-enforced development** with custom compliance requirements
- **Role-specific coding assistance** (e.g., database expert, security reviewer)
- **Projects requiring strict adherence** to coding standards

Choose Roo Code when you need more fine-grained control over what the AI can do, or when you want specialized assistance for different types of coding tasks.

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot is best for:
- **Quick, inline code completions** as you type
- **Rapid prototyping** and first drafts of functions
- **Learning new APIs or libraries** with interactive suggestions
- **Boilerplate code generation** and repetitive patterns
- **Faster coding velocity** for routine tasks
- **Immediate suggestions** that feel like pair programming

Choose GitHub Copilot when you want seamless, real-time suggestions that integrate directly into your coding flow without breaking your concentration.

## Using Tools Together

These AI assistants can complement each other effectively:

### Complementary Workflow Strategy

1. **GitHub Copilot** for rapid coding and quick suggestions during active development
2. **Claude Code** for deeper project understanding, complex problem-solving, and detailed explanations
3. **Roo Code** for specialized tasks with custom rules and strict requirements

### Configuration for Co-existence

This setup script provides options to configure these tools to work together with minimal conflicts:

- You can choose to **disable Copilot** entirely when using Claude/Roo
- You can **prioritize Claude/Roo** over Copilot for suggestions
- You can **enable all assistants** but use them for different contexts

The VS Code settings configured by this script help manage potential conflicts between these tools.

## Potential Conflicts

When using multiple AI assistants simultaneously, be aware of potential conflicts:

1. **Suggestion overlaps**: Multiple assistants may suggest completions at the same time
2. **Performance impacts**: Running multiple AI models can affect system resources
3. **Context confusion**: Different assistants have different context windows and knowledge
4. **UI clutter**: Multiple suggestion interfaces can create visual noise
5. **Command conflicts**: Some keyboard shortcuts may conflict between extensions

## Conclusion

Each AI coding assistant has its strengths and optimal use cases. Many developers find that using a combination of these tools provides the best overall experience, leveraging the strengths of each for different aspects of the development process.

The configuration options in this setup script allow you to customize how these tools work together in your environment, providing flexibility to create your ideal AI-assisted coding workflow.
