# Phase 2: Basic Workflow Implementation

## Objective
Implement the core k6 load testing workflow with essential features including test execution, results collection, and threshold validation.

## Technical Specifications

### Core Workflow Structure
- Single job with multiple steps
- Conditional execution based on inputs
- Error handling and status reporting
- Results artifact management

### Key Components
1. **k6 Installation**: Dynamic version management
2. **Test Execution**: Local and cloud execution paths
3. **Results Processing**: JSON and HTML report generation
4. **Threshold Validation**: Pass/fail determination
5. **Artifact Upload**: Results storage and accessibility

## Tasks

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/k6-load-test.yml` with basic structure
- [ ] Implement k6 installation step with version management
- [ ] Add test script validation step
- [ ] Implement local test execution with proper error handling
- [ ] Add k6 Cloud execution path (conditional)
- [ ] Implement results processing and summary generation
- [ ] Add threshold validation logic
- [ ] Implement artifact upload for test results
- [ ] Add job outputs for integration
- [ ] Create basic error handling and status reporting

## Documentation
- Document each workflow step purpose
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Create troubleshooting section

## Expected Outcomes
- Working k6 workflow that can execute basic tests
- Proper error handling and status reporting
- Test results available as artifacts
- Clear pass/fail status based on thresholds
- Integration-ready outputs

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Workflow syntax validation passes
- [ ] Basic smoke test execution works
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Artifacts uploaded successfully
- [ ] Outputs populated correctly
