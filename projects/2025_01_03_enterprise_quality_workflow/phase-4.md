# Phase 4: Compliance and Enterprise Features

## Objective
Add compliance framework support and enterprise-grade features including audit logging, compliance reporting, and integration with enterprise tooling.

## Important Note
This phase implements **compliance automation tooling**, not actual compliance certification. It provides:
- Automated evidence collection for audits
- Policy-as-code enforcement
- Audit trail generation
- Control validation

**No external accounts required** - this uses only:
- GitHub's built-in features (environments, protection rules)
- Your existing security tool results
- Optional webhooks to your enterprise systems
- Local audit log generation

## Technical Specifications

### What This Actually Does
The compliance features help you **prepare for** audits by:

1. **SOC 2 Type II** Support
   - Automatically logs all changes (who, what, when)
   - Enforces approval requirements for production
   - Collects security scan results as evidence

2. **ISO 27001** Support
   - Validates that security scans were run
   - Creates audit trails for risk management
   - Generates reports for auditors

3. **HIPAA** Support
   - Flags if sensitive data patterns are detected
   - Ensures encryption in transit (HTTPS)
   - Logs access controls

4. **PCI-DSS** Support
   - Detects credit card patterns in code
   - Enforces security testing
   - Tracks vulnerability remediation

**Think of it as**: An automated checklist that runs with every build and generates reports you can show auditors.

### Enterprise Features
1. **Audit Logging**
   - Workflow execution history
   - Security scan results
   - Approval workflows
   - Change tracking

2. **Compliance Reporting**
   - Automated evidence collection
   - Compliance dashboards
   - Audit trail generation
   - Policy violation alerts

3. **Enterprise Integrations**
   - SIEM integration
   - Ticketing system hooks
   - Approval workflows
   - Custom notifications

## Tasks

### Task 1: Design Compliance Framework Architecture
- [ ] Create compliance configuration schema
- [ ] Design evidence collection strategy
- [ ] Plan audit trail structure
- [ ] Define compliance policies as code

```yaml
# This is just a workflow input parameter, not a separate service

      with:
        script: |
          const auditLog = {
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
            workflow: '${{ github.workflow }}',
            run_id: '${{ github.run_id }}',
            actor: '${{ github.actor }}',
            event: '${{ github.event_name }}',
            ref: '${{ github.ref }}',
            jobs: {
              // Collect all job statuses
            },
            compliance: {
              framework: '${{ inputs.compliance_framework }}',
              controls_validated: [],
              policy_violations: []
            }
          };
          
    - name: Export audit log
      run: |
        # Save as workflow artifact (no external service needed)
        echo "$auditLog" > audit-log-${{ github.run_id }}.json
        
    - name: Upload audit log
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: audit-log
        path: audit-log-*.json
        retention-days: ${{ inputs.audit_retention_days || 90 }}
```

### Task 3: Implement Compliance Validation
- [ ] Create compliance check job
- [ ] Implement control validation logic
- [ ] Add policy enforcement
- [ ] Create violation reporting

```yaml
compliance_check:
  name: âœ… Compliance Validation
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: ${{ inputs.compliance_framework != 'none' }}
  steps:
    - name: Load compliance policies
      run: |
        # Load framework-specific policies
        
    - name: Validate security controls
      run: |
        # Check if required security scans passed
        
    - name: Validate change management
      if: ${{ inputs.compliance_framework == 'soc2' }}
      run: |
        # Verify approval requirements
        
    - name: Generate compliance report

        # Create evidence package
```

### Task 4: Add Enterprise Notifications (Optional)
- [ ] Implement webhook notifications
- [ ] Add email alerts for violations
- [ ] Create Slack/Teams integration
- [ ] Add custom notification channels

```yaml
# Only runs if you've configured webhooks - completely optional

  if: failure() && env.WEBHOOK_URL != ''
  env:
    WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.COMPLIANCE_WEBHOOK }}  # Optional
  run: |
    # Simple webhook notification - customize for your system
    if [ ! -z "$WEBHOOK_URL" ]; then
      curl -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "severity": "high",
          "event": "compliance_violation",
          "workflow": "${{ github.workflow }}",

  environment: 
    name: production  # Configure protection rules in repo settings
  steps:
    - name: Log approval
      run: |
