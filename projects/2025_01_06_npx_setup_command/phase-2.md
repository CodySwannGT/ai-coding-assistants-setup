# Phase 2: Template Copying Implementation

## Objective
Implement the core functionality to recursively copy templates while handling file conflicts gracefully.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create recursive directory walker for templates folder
- [ ] Implement file copying with structure preservation
- [ ] Add conflict detection for existing files
- [ ] Implement user prompts for overwrite decisions
- [ ] Track and display skipped files with template locations
- [ ] Add progress indicators during copying

## Technical Specifications

**Core Functions:**
```javascript
// Main copy function
async function copyTemplates(targetDir) {
  // Walk templates directory
  // For each file:
  //   - Check if exists in target
  //   - If exists, prompt user
  //   - Copy or skip based on response
  //   - Track results
}

// Conflict handling
async function handleConflict(file) {
  // Prompt: Overwrite, Skip, View diff
  // Return user choice
}
```

**User Prompts:**
- "File X already exists. Overwrite? (y/n/d for diff)"
- Show template location for skipped files
- Summary at the end of what was copied/skipped

## Quality Assurance

- Test copying to empty directory
- Test with conflicting files
- Verify directory structure is preserved
- Ensure hidden files (.env, .gitignore) are copied

## Documentation

- Document the conflict resolution flow
- Add examples of the prompts users will see

## Expected Outcomes

- Templates are copied maintaining exact structure
- Users have control over file conflicts
- Clear feedback about what was copied or skipped
- Template locations provided for manual review
