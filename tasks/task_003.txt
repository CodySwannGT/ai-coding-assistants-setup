# Task ID: 3
# Title: Update Documentation for AI Tool Comparison
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update documentation to clarify differences between Claude, Roo, and Copilot, helping users choose the appropriate tool.
# Details:
Create a new markdown document that compares the three AI coding assistants:

1. Create a comparison table with features, strengths, and limitations
2. Add usage recommendations for different scenarios
3. Include information about how the tools can be used together
4. Add screenshots of each tool in action

The document should be placed in the docs/ directory and linked from the main README.md. Include information about the new Copilot detection and override features.

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Have multiple team members review the documentation. Verify all links work correctly.
