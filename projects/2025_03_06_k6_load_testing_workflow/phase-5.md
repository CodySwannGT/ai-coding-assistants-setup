# Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

## Objective
Thoroughly test the k6 workflow implementation, create comprehensive documentation, and ensure the solution is production-ready.

## Technical Specifications

### Testing Requirements
1. **Unit Testing**: Individual workflow components
2. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow execution
3. **Scenario Testing**: All k6 scenarios validated
4. **Error Testing**: Failure modes handled correctly
5. **Performance Meta-Testing**: Workflow execution time

### Documentation Deliverables
