# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Uninstall Functionality in Setup Script
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a "remove" option to the setup script that allows users to completely uninstall the tool, removing all configurations, hooks, and settings previously established, with appropriate warnings and confirmation requirements.
# Details:
The implementation should include:

1. Add a new "--remove" or "--uninstall" command-line flag to the setup script.
2. Create a dedicated function that handles the uninstallation process.
3. Implement a tracking mechanism that records all changes made during setup (if not already present), such as:
   - Git hooks installed
   - VS Code configurations added
   - MCP settings modified
   - Any other files or configurations created
4. Display a clear, prominent warning about the destructive nature of the operation, using colored text (red) if supported.
5. Require explicit confirmation from the user with a typed response (e.g., "YES" or the project name) to proceed.
6. Implement the removal logic for each component:
   - Remove Git hooks from .git/hooks directory
   - Restore original VS Code settings or remove added configurations
   - Remove MCP settings or restore defaults
   - Delete any created directories or files
7. Provide verbose logging during the removal process, informing the user about each step.
8. Handle error cases gracefully, such as:
   - Files already manually removed
   - Permission issues
   - Unexpected file states
9. After completion, display a summary of all removed items.
10. Consider adding a "--dry-run" option that shows what would be removed without actually performing the removal.

The implementation should follow the same code style and patterns used in the existing setup script, maintaining consistency with how other features like the AI-enhanced Git diff, test-first enforcement, and branching strategy are implemented.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the uninstall functionality works correctly and safely:

1. Manual Testing:
   - Run the setup script with the new remove option on a test environment
   - Verify all prompts and warnings display correctly
   - Confirm the confirmation mechanism prevents accidental removal
   - Check that all components are properly removed
   - Verify the system returns to its pre-installation state

2. Automated Testing:
   - Create unit tests for the removal function logic
   - Develop integration tests that:
     - Set up a mock environment with all components installed
     - Run the removal process
     - Verify each component is properly removed
     - Check for any leftover files or configurations

3. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test the removal process on a system where some components were already manually deleted
   - Test with insufficient permissions
   - Test with corrupted configuration files
   - Test cancellation mid-process

4. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have team members test the removal process on their development environments
   - Collect feedback on the clarity of warnings and confirmation prompts
   - Verify the process is intuitive and meets user expectations

5. Documentation Testing:
   - Review help text and documentation for clarity
   - Ensure the removal option is properly documented in README and help commands

The test results should be documented, including screenshots of the process and a checklist of all components verified to be properly removed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add command-line flags and implement tracking mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add '--remove' and '--uninstall' command-line flags to the setup script and implement a tracking mechanism to record all changes made during setup.
### Details:
1. Add new command-line arguments to the argument parser for '--remove' and '--uninstall' (as aliases).
2. Create a JSON-based tracking file (e.g., '.tool-installation.json') that records all modifications made during setup.
3. Update all existing setup functions to record their actions in this tracking file.
4. Include timestamps, file paths, original states, and new states in the tracking data.
5. Implement a function to read this tracking file during uninstallation.

## 2. Implement warning and confirmation UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Create a user interface for displaying warnings and obtaining confirmation before proceeding with uninstallation.
### Details:
1. Implement a function to display a prominent warning message in red text (using ANSI color codes if supported).
2. Create a confirmation prompt that requires the user to type 'YES' or the project name to proceed.
3. Add a '--force' option to bypass confirmation for automated scripts.
4. Implement a '--dry-run' flag that shows what would be removed without performing actual changes.
5. Create helper functions for displaying verbose logging during the removal process.

## 3. Implement Git hooks removal functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Create functions to remove Git hooks that were installed by the setup script.
### Details:
1. Use the tracking file to identify which Git hooks were installed.
2. Implement a function to remove each hook from the .git/hooks directory.
3. If original hooks were backed up during installation, restore them.
4. Handle edge cases such as manually deleted hooks or modified hooks.
5. Log each removal action with appropriate verbosity levels.

## 4. Implement VS Code and MCP settings removal [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Create functions to remove or restore VS Code settings and MCP configurations that were modified during setup.
### Details:
1. Use the tracking file to identify which VS Code settings were modified.
2. Implement functions to restore original VS Code settings or remove added configurations.
3. Create similar functions for MCP settings restoration.
4. Handle cases where settings files might have been manually modified since installation.
5. Implement backup restoration for any configuration files that were backed up during installation.

## 5. Implement main uninstall function and summary reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3, 21.4
### Description: Create the main uninstall function that orchestrates the removal process and provides a summary of actions taken.
### Details:
1. Create a main 'uninstall' function that calls each component removal function in the appropriate order.
2. Implement error handling that continues the uninstallation process even if individual components fail to uninstall.
3. Track successful and failed removal actions.
4. After completion, generate and display a summary of all removed items.
5. Include recommendations for manual cleanup if any automated removal steps failed.
6. Delete the tracking file itself as the final step of a successful uninstallation.
