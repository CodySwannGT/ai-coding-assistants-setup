# Phase 1: Project Setup & CLI Structure

## Objective
Set up the basic NPX command structure with proper package.json configuration and CLI entry point.

## Tasks

- [ ] Update package.json with proper metadata and bin configuration
- [ ] Create bin/index.js as the CLI entry point
- [ ] Set up basic command-line argument parsing
- [ ] Add shebang and make the file executable
- [ ] Test npx execution locally with npm link

## Technical Specifications

**Package.json Configuration:**
```json
{
  "name": "ai-coding-assistants-setup",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "description": "Enterprise-grade development workflow automation powered by AI coding assistants",
  "bin": {
    "ai-coding-assistants-setup": "./bin/index.js"
  },
  "files": [
    "bin/",
    "src/",
    "templates/"
  ],
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Dependencies:**
- `prompts` or `inquirer` - for user interactions
- `chalk` - for colored output
- `fs-extra` - for enhanced file operations

## Quality Assurance

- Verify `npx .` works from project root
- Ensure CLI displays help message
- Check that Node.js version requirement is enforced

## Documentation

- Update main README.md with npx usage instructions
  - Add npx installation command: `npx ai-coding-assistants-setup`
  - Update the setup section to mention the automated setup option
  - Keep existing manual setup instructions as an alternative
- Document development setup with npm link

## Expected Outcomes

- Working CLI that can be invoked with npx
- Basic command structure ready for feature implementation
- Local testing environment set up
