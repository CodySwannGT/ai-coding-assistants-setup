# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Optional Branching Strategy Enforcement
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to enforce development best practices for Git branching, including detection of work on main/master branches, warnings to users, and Claude-powered suggestions for appropriate branch names based on task descriptions. Present this as an optional feature during setup/update with clear user choice.
# Details:
This task involves implementing an optional enforcement mechanism for branching strategy best practices:

1. **Branch Detection System**:
   - Create a mechanism to detect when a developer is working directly on main/master branches
   - Implement warning notifications when direct work on protected branches is detected
   - Add configuration options to enable/disable this feature and customize protected branch names

2. **New Branch Enforcement**:
   - Develop functionality to verify that each task begins on a new branch
   - Create a system to track task-to-branch relationships
   - Implement pre-commit hooks that check if the current branch is appropriate for the task

3. **Claude Integration for Branch Naming**:
   - Integrate with Claude API to analyze task descriptions
   - Implement logic for Claude to suggest appropriate branch names following common conventions (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/, etc.)
   - Create a user-friendly interface for accepting or modifying suggested branch names

4. **Configuration Options**:
   - Add configuration parameters in the project's config file for:
     - Enabling/disabling branching enforcement
     - Customizing branch naming conventions
     - Setting protected branch names
     - Configuring warning behavior (blocking vs. advisory)

5. **User Experience Considerations**:
   - Ensure warnings are clear and actionable
   - Provide guidance on how to correct branching issues
   - Make it easy to create a new branch from the warning interface

6. **Integration with Existing Hooks**:
   - Leverage the extended Git hooks implementation from Task #17
   - Ensure compatibility with other hook functionality

7. **Setup/Update Integration**:
   - Present branching strategy enforcement as an explicit opt-in feature during setup/update
   - Provide a clear description of the feature's purpose and benefits
   - Require explicit user confirmation before enabling
   - Ensure the feature is disabled by default unless specifically chosen by the user
   - Include screenshots or examples of how the feature works in the description

This feature should be implemented as an optional module that can be enabled/disabled through configuration, with sensible defaults that follow industry standard Git workflows, but should never be enabled without explicit user consent.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature will involve multiple approaches:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test branch detection logic with various branch names and configurations
   - Verify Claude integration for branch name suggestions with mocked API responses
   - Test configuration parsing and validation

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Create test Git repositories with various branching scenarios
   - Verify that warnings trigger appropriately when working on protected branches
   - Test the full flow of task creation, branch suggestion, and enforcement

3. **Mock Testing**:
   - Use mock Claude API responses to test branch name suggestion functionality
   - Simulate various task descriptions and verify appropriate branch name suggestions

4. **Configuration Testing**:
   - Test with various configuration options enabled/disabled
   - Verify that protected branch lists are correctly interpreted
   - Test custom branch naming convention configurations
   - Verify that the feature is disabled by default in new installations

5. **User Experience Testing**:
   - Manually verify warning messages are clear and actionable
   - Test the UX flow for creating a new branch from a warning
   - Ensure suggestions are helpful and relevant to task descriptions
   - Test the setup/update flow to confirm clear presentation of the feature as optional
   - Verify that enabling requires explicit user confirmation

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test behavior when no task description is available
   - Verify handling of unusual branch names or structures
   - Test performance with large repositories or complex branching structures

7. **Regression Testing**:
   - Ensure existing Git hook functionality continues to work
   - Verify that other features are not affected by the branching enforcement
   - Confirm that updates to existing installations don't enable the feature without user consent

Document all test cases and expected outcomes in the test suite, with particular attention to the configuration options and their effects on system behavior. Include specific test cases for the setup/update experience to ensure the opt-in nature of the feature is preserved.
