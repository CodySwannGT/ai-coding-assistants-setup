## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Files Created and Modified

| File | Purpose | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `.claude/settings.json` | Claude configuration | Project settings including memory limits and ignore patterns |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project context | Primary context file for Claude Code |
| `.roo/settings.json` | Roo configuration | Configuration for Roo Code |
| `.roo/mcp.json` | Roo MCP config | MCP server configuration for Roo |
| `.roo/rules/` | Custom instructions | Directives for Roo Code |
| `.roomodes` | Custom mode definitions | Specialized AI roles for different tasks |
| `.rooignore` | Excluded files | Patterns for files Roo should ignore |
| `.mcp.json` | MCP configuration | Global MCP server configuration |
| `.gitignore` | Version control | Updated with AI-specific patterns |
| `.vscode/settings.json` | VS Code settings | Editor settings for AI assistants |
| `.env.example` | Environment variables | Template for required env variables |

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Project Detection

The script first identifies your project type (standard or monorepo) by:
- Checking for `package.json` workspaces property
- Detecting `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or `turbo.json`
- Analyzing directory structure

This allows it to adapt the configuration to your specific project structure.

### 2. Claude Code Configuration

For Claude Code, the script:
- Configures the memory limits based on project size
- Sets up API key encryption for security
- Creates project-specific settings in `.claude/settings.json`
- Generates the `CLAUDE.md` file for project context
- Configures proper ignore patterns

### 3. Roo Code Configuration

For Roo Code, the script:
- Sets up AI provider configurations (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Configures token limits and operation auto-approvals
- Creates standard rules in `.roo/rules/` directory
- Sets up `.rooignore` file for proper file exclusion
- Configures custom modes for specialized AI roles

### 4. MCP Server Integration

The script provides flexible MCP server configuration:
- Configures GitHub, Context7, Memory, and other servers
- Synchronizes server settings between Claude and Roo
- Sets up appropriate environment variables
- Creates templates for sensitive configuration
- Supports local override files for personal settings

### 5. Git Integration

For proper version control integration:
- Updates `.gitignore` with appropriate patterns
- Ensures shared configurations are NOT ignored
- Makes sure sensitive files ARE ignored
- Creates `.env.example` with required variables

### 6. VS Code Integration

For optimal VS Code experience:
- Configures editor settings for AI assistants
- Recommends required extensions
- Sets up keyboard shortcuts optimizations
- Ensures consistent experience across the team

## üìä MCP Server Configuration

The script provides flexible MCP server configuration at multiple levels:

### Task Master AI Integration

When using Task Master AI, this script automatically adds the proper configuration to your `.gitignore` file to ensure that task files aren't committed to version control:

```
# Task Master AI files
.taskmasterconfig
tasks/*.txt
tasks/task_*.txt
# Allow tracking tasks.json for project structure but not individual task files
!tasks/tasks.json
```

This prevents cluttering your repository with individual task files while still allowing you to track the main task configuration file (`tasks.json`) for project structure and task organization.

### Global MCP Servers

These servers are configured at the system level and available across all projects.

### Project MCP Servers

These are configured at the project level in `.mcp.json` and `.roo/mcp.json` and are committed to the repository for team sharing:

```json
// .mcp.json (for Claude Code)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      }
    },
    "context7-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "${CONTEXT7_API_KEY}"
      }
    },
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-knowledge-graph", "--memory-path", "${MEMORY_PATH}"],
      "autoapprove": [
        "create_entities",
        "create_relations",
        "add_observations",
        "delete_entities",
        "delete_observations",
        "delete_relations",
        "read_graph",
        "search_nodes",
        "open_nodes"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local MCP Server Overrides

For personalized or sensitive configurations, the script creates:

1. **`.mcp.json.local`**: Personal Claude Code MCP servers (gitignored)
2. **`.roo/mcp.json.local`**: Personal Roo Code MCP servers (gitignored)

These override files use the same format as their non-local counterparts but are excluded from version control, allowing for:

- Personal API keys
- Developer-specific tool configurations
- Testing experimental MCP servers
- Environment-specific settings

## üîß Custom Modes for Roo Code

The script helps you set up specialized AI roles for different tasks:

```json
// .roomodes
{
  "customModes": [
    {
      "slug": "architect",
      "name": "üèóÔ∏è Architect",
      "roleDefinition": "You are an expert software architect specializing in designing scalable, maintainable systems. You excel at creating clear architectural diagrams, defining interfaces, and planning project structure.",
      "groups": ["read", "edit", "command"],
      "customInstructions": "Focus on modular design principles, separation of concerns, and clear documentation of interfaces between components."
    },
    {
      "slug": "tdd",
      "name": "üß™ TDD Developer",
      "roleDefinition": "You are a test-driven development specialist who follows a strict red-green-refactor workflow. You always write tests before implementation code.",
      "groups": [
        "read", 
        ["edit", { 
          "fileRegex": "\\.(test|spec)\\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$", 
          "description": "Test files only" 
        }]
      ],
      "customInstructions": "Follow the TDD workflow: 1) Write a failing test, 2) Write minimal code to make the test pass, 3) Refactor while keeping tests green. Never write implementation before tests."
    }
  ]
}
```

## üßπ Uninstalling

The script provides comprehensive uninstall functionality to completely remove all AI assistant configurations when needed.

### Listing AI Assistant Files

To see what files would be affected without making any changes:

```bash
npx ai-coding-assistants-setup --list-files
```

This will display all AI assistant-related files and directories in your project.

### Dry Run Uninstall

To perform a dry run that shows what would be removed without actually removing anything:

```bash
npx ai-coding-assistants-setup --remove --dry-run
```

This is useful to preview the impact before committing to removal.

### Standard Uninstall

To remove all AI assistant configuration files:

```bash
npx ai-coding-assistants-setup --remove
```

This removes:
- `.claude/` directory and related files

- `.mcp.json` and `.mcp.json.local` files
- `CLAUDE.md` file
- `.roomodes` file
- AI-related environment variables in `.env`
- Git hooks added by the script

Note: VS Code settings related to AI assistants are preserved by default.

### Complete Uninstall

To remove all AI assistant files including VS Code settings:

```bash
npx ai-coding-assistants-setup --remove-all
```

This performs a standard uninstall plus:
- Removes AI assistant settings from VS Code settings.json
