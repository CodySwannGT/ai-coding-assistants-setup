# Phase 2: Basic Workflow Implementation

## Objective
Implement the core k6 load testing workflow with essential features including test execution, results collection, and threshold validation.

## Technical Specifications

### Core Workflow Structure
- Single job with multiple steps
- Conditional execution based on inputs
- Error handling and status reporting
- Results artifact management

### Key Components
1. **k6 Installation**: Dynamic version management
2. **Test Execution**: Local and cloud execution paths
3. **Results Processing**: JSON and HTML report generation
4. **Threshold Validation**: Pass/fail determination
5. **Artifact Upload**: Results storage and accessibility

## Tasks

- [x] Create `.github/workflows/k6-load-test.yml` with basic structure
- [x] Implement k6 installation step with version management
- [x] Add test script validation step
- [x] Implement local test execution with proper error handling
- [x] Add k6 Cloud execution path (conditional)
- [x] Implement results processing and summary generation
- [x] Add threshold validation logic
- [x] Implement artifact upload for test results
- [x] Add job outputs for integration
- [x] Create basic error handling and status reporting

## Documentation
- Document each workflow step purpose
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Create troubleshooting section

## Expected Outcomes
- Working k6 workflow that can execute basic tests
- Proper error handling and status reporting
- Test results available as artifacts
- Clear pass/fail status based on thresholds
- Integration-ready outputs

## Quality Assurance
- [x] Workflow syntax validation passes
- [x] Basic smoke test execution works
- [x] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [x] Artifacts uploaded successfully
- [x] Outputs populated correctly
