# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Extended Git Hooks with Claude CLI Integration
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 14, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the existing Git hook implementation to support additional hooks including prepare-commit-msg, commit-msg, pre-push, post-merge, post-checkout, post-rewrite, and pre-rebase, with Claude CLI integration for each hook. All hooks will be optional and require explicit user opt-in during setup.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive set of Git hooks beyond the existing pre-commit hook, with Claude CLI integration for each. All hooks will be optional and require explicit user confirmation to enable:

1. **prepare-commit-msg hook**: 
   - Implement auto-generation of commit messages based on staged changes
   - Use Claude to analyze diff and suggest meaningful commit messages
   - Allow customization of message templates and formats
   - Respect existing commit messages if manually provided

2. **commit-msg hook**:
   - Validate commit message structure against configurable rules
   - Use Claude to check for clarity, completeness, and adherence to conventions
   - Implement support for conventional commits format
   - Provide feedback and suggestions for improving commit messages

3. **pre-push hook**:
   - Implement security and quality audits before pushing code
   - Use Claude to analyze outgoing commits for sensitive information
   - Check for large files, credentials, or other problematic content
   - Allow configuration of audit strictness levels from Task #15

4. **post-merge hook**:
   - Generate summaries of merged changes
   - Use Claude to create human-readable explanations of what changed
   - Highlight potential areas requiring attention after merge
   - Integrate with notification systems if configured

5. **post-checkout hook**:
   - Implement context loading when switching branches
   - Use Claude to summarize branch state and recent activity
   - Provide relevant information about the checked-out branch
   - Suggest next steps based on branch purpose (feature, bugfix, etc.)

6. **post-rewrite hook**:
   - Generate summaries after rebase or amend operations
   - Use Claude to explain what changed during the rewrite
   - Highlight potential issues from the rewrite operation
   - Provide guidance on next steps

7. **pre-rebase hook**:
   - Implement conflict prediction before rebasing
   - Use Claude to analyze potential merge conflicts
   - Provide suggestions for resolving predicted conflicts
   - Allow configuration of conflict detection sensitivity

For each hook:
- Ensure proper error handling and graceful degradation if Claude is unavailable
- Implement bypass mechanisms for urgent situations
- Add appropriate logging and telemetry
- Ensure hooks respect the configuration settings from Task #15
- Document hook behavior and configuration options
- Optimize Claude prompts for each specific hook purpose
- Provide clear descriptions for users during the setup process
- Make each hook individually selectable during setup/update
- No hooks should be enabled by default without explicit user confirmation

The implementation should build upon the existing hook infrastructure from Task #14, maintaining consistency in the codebase and user experience.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this task will involve a comprehensive approach to verify each Git hook's functionality:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Create unit tests for each hook's core logic
   - Mock Claude API responses to test different scenarios
   - Verify proper handling of edge cases and error conditions
   - Test configuration options and their effects on hook behavior
   - Test the hook selection mechanism during setup

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Set up test repositories with various states to trigger hooks
   - Verify Claude integration works end-to-end for each hook
   - Test interactions between multiple hooks in sequence
   - Verify hooks respect global and per-repository configurations
   - Test the setup wizard with various hook selection combinations

3. **Specific Hook Tests**:
   - **prepare-commit-msg**: Test with various staged changes to verify message generation
   - **commit-msg**: Test with valid and invalid commit messages against different rule sets
   - **pre-push**: Test with clean code and code containing security issues
   - **post-merge**: Test with simple and complex merges to verify summary generation
   - **post-checkout**: Test branch switching between different types of branches
   - **post-rewrite**: Test after rebase and amend operations
   - **pre-rebase**: Test with branches having varying levels of conflict potential

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure hook execution time with various repository sizes
   - Verify hooks don't significantly impact Git operations
   - Test with simulated slow network conditions
   - Ensure hooks timeout appropriately when Claude is unresponsive

5. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Create scenarios for manual testing of each hook
   - Verify the usefulness and accuracy of Claude's responses
   - Assess the clarity and helpfulness of messages to users
   - Test with developers of varying Git experience levels
   - Test the hook selection interface for usability and clarity
   - Verify that only selected hooks are installed and active

6. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Verify all hooks are properly documented
   - Ensure configuration options are clearly explained
   - Check that examples are provided for common use cases
   - Verify troubleshooting guidance is included
   - Verify hook descriptions in the setup wizard are clear and accurate

7. **Regression Testing**:
   - Verify existing pre-commit hook functionality is preserved
   - Ensure configuration from Task #15 still works correctly
   - Check that all hooks can be individually enabled/disabled
   - Verify that previously selected hooks remain enabled after updates

The testing should be automated where possible, with CI integration to prevent regressions in future development.
