# Phase 5: Testing & Publishing

## Objective
Perform manual testing of the npx command and publish to npm registry.

## Tasks

- [ ] Test npx command in various scenarios
- [ ] Add --dry-run option for preview mode
- [ ] Create usage examples and demos
- [ ] Update main README.md with installation instructions
- [ ] Publish to npm registry
- [ ] Test installation from npm

## Technical Specifications

**Testing Scenarios:**
1. Fresh project with no conflicts
2. Project with existing files (test prompts)
3. Project without package.json
4. Project with existing scripts
5. Different package managers (npm, yarn, bun)

**Dry Run Mode:**
```javascript
if (args.dryRun) {
  console.log('DRY RUN MODE - No files will be modified');
  // Show what would be copied
  // Show what scripts would be added
}
```

**Publishing Checklist:**
```bash
# Pre-publish
npm run lint
npm run build
npm version patch/minor/major
npm pack --dry-run

# Publish
npm publish

# Post-publish verification
npx ai-coding-assistants-setup --version
```

## Quality Assurance

- Test all user interaction flows
- Verify files are copied correctly
- Ensure package.json updates work
- Test from npm registry after publishing

## Documentation

- Update main README with:
  - New "Quick Start" section at the top with: `npx ai-coding-assistants-setup`
  - Explanation that this automates the entire setup process
  - Options and flags (--dry-run, --help)
  - What files get copied and modified
  - Before/after examples showing package.json changes
  - Keep existing manual setup as "Manual Setup" section
- Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- Include demo GIF if possible showing the setup process

## Expected Outcomes

- Tool works reliably in all test scenarios
- Published to npm and installable via npx
- Clear documentation for end users
- Smooth setup experience for AI coding assistants
