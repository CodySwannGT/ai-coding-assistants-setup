# Phase 4: Integration Patterns and Examples

## Objective
Create comprehensive integration examples showing how customers can incorporate the k6 load testing workflow into their deployment pipelines.

## Technical Specifications

### Integration Patterns
1. **Post-Deployment Testing**: Run after successful deployment
2. **Pre-Production Gate**: Block production deployment on test failure
3. **Scheduled Testing**: Regular performance baseline checks
4. **Manual Trigger**: On-demand performance validation
5. **Multi-Environment**: Progressive testing through environments

### Example Implementations
- AWS deployment integration
- Azure deployment integration
- Kubernetes deployment integration
- Docker-based deployment integration
- Traditional VM deployment integration

## Tasks

- [x] Create integration patterns documentation (replaced individual examples)
- [x] Document multi-environment testing strategies
- [x] Document scheduled performance testing patterns
- [x] Create rollback-on-failure documentation
- [x] Add cost optimization patterns guide
- [x] Create comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- [x] Create scenario selection decision tree
- [ ] ~~Create notification integration examples~~ (Not needed per requirements)
- [ ] ~~Implement results comparison with baselines~~ (Deferred to future enhancement)

## Documentation
- Integration cookbook with patterns
- Decision tree for test scenario selection
- Cost considerations guide
- Troubleshooting common integration issues
- Best practices for CI/CD integration

## Expected Outcomes
- 5+ working integration examples
- Clear patterns for different use cases
- Cost-optimized testing strategies
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Ready-to-use workflow templates

## Quality Assurance
- [x] All patterns are validated and correct
- [x] Integration patterns cover common use cases
- [x] Documentation is clear and actionable
- [x] Cost implications documented
- [x] Troubleshooting covers common issues
