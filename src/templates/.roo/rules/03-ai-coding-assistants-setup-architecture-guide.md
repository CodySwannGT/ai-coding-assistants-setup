# Project Architecture Guide

This project is organized as follows:

- Follow the repository's established patterns
- Use absolute imports with module aliases when available
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Limit file size to maintain readability (aim for under 500 lines)
- Refer to parent project documentation for architectural guidelines
