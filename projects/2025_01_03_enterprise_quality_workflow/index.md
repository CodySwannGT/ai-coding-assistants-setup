# Enterprise Quality Workflow Enhancement Project

## Project Name
Enterprise-Ready GitHub Actions Quality Workflow

## Project Overview
Transform the existing quality.yml workflow into an enterprise-grade CI/CD quality assurance pipeline that maintains AI-powered scanning capabilities while adding traditional security tools, compliance frameworks, and performance optimizations.

## Project Rules and Conventions

### Coding Standards
- All YAML files must follow proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Workflow files must include comprehensive comments
- Reusable workflow patterns should be employed where possible
- All secrets must use least-privilege principles

### Testing Requirements
- Each phase must include validation of workflow syntax
- Changes must be tested in a feature branch before merging
- All new jobs must have skip conditions for flexibility

### Documentation Standards
- Each job must have clear documentation of its purpose
- Secret requirements must be documented with required scopes
- Usage examples must be provided for all configuration options

## Phases

### [Phase 1: AI Scanner Failure Tolerance](phase-1.md)
Modify existing AI scanners (Claude code quality and security) to continue on error while preserving their functionality. Ensure proper error handling and reporting.

### [Phase 2: Traditional Security Tools Integration](phase-2.md)
Add enterprise-standard security scanning tools including SAST, dependency scanning, secret detection, and license compliance checking.

### [Phase 3: Performance Optimization](phase-3.md)
Implement caching strategies, parallel job execution, and dependency optimization to reduce workflow execution time.

### [Phase 4: Compliance and Enterprise Features](phase-4.md)
Add compliance framework support (SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), audit logging, and enterprise reporting capabilities.

### [Phase 5: Secret Management Enhancement](phase-5.md) **[SKIPPED]**
~~Implement OIDC authentication, least-privilege token management, and secure secret handling patterns.~~ 
**Status: DEFERRED** - Continuing to use GitHub Secrets for now. This phase is preserved for future implementation.

### [Phase 6: Testing and Documentation](phase-6.md)
Create comprehensive tests for the workflow, update documentation, and provide migration guides for existing users.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] AI scanners continue workflow execution on failure
- [ ] Traditional security tools are integrated and configurable
- [ ] Workflow execution time is reduced by at least 30%
- [ ] Compliance frameworks are supported
- [ ] Secret management follows enterprise best practices
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and examples are provided

## Technical Stack
- GitHub Actions
- Node.js ecosystem tools
- Security scanning tools (Snyk, SonarQube, etc.)
- Claude AI API (optional)
- OIDC providers for authentication
