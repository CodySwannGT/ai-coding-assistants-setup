# Enterprise Release Workflow Enhancement

## Project Name
Enterprise-Grade Release Pipeline Implementation

## Project Rules and Conventions

### AWS Requirements
- AWS Profile: `gemini-dev-v2`
- CDK Context: `--context env=dev --context dev-account=017820663466`

### Quality Standards
- All code changes must pass linting, formatting, type checking, and tests
- Zero tolerance for failing tests - no exceptions
- All CDK infrastructure must synthesize without errors
- Comprehensive documentation for all configurations

### Workflow Standards
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Implement proper secret management
- Use reusable workflows where appropriate
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Project Overview

This project evaluates and enhances the `.github/workflows/release.yml` file to meet enterprise production standards. The current workflow has several gaps that need to be addressed for enterprise-grade deployments.

## Current State Analysis

The existing release workflow provides basic functionality but lacks several critical enterprise features:

### Strengths
- Uses workflow_call for reusability
- Includes quality checks
- Supports multiple environments
- Has version management with standard-version
- Includes basic Jira integration

### Identified Gaps
1. **Security & Compliance**
   - No dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Limited secret management
   - No SBOM generation
   - Missing compliance checks

2. **Reliability & Resilience**
   - No retry mechanisms for critical steps
   - Limited error handling
   - No rollback capabilities
   - Missing health checks

3. **Observability**
   - No detailed logging
   - Missing metrics collection
   - No notification systems
   - Limited audit trail

4. **Enterprise Features**
   - No artifact signing
   - Missing deployment gates
   - No approval workflows
   - Limited environment validation

## Implementation Phases

### [Phase 1: Security & Compliance Enhancements](./phase-1.md)
Implement comprehensive security scanning, secret management, and compliance checks to meet enterprise security standards.

### [Phase 2: Reliability & Error Handling](./phase-2.md)
Add retry mechanisms, proper error handling, rollback capabilities, and health check validations.

### [Phase 3: Observability & Monitoring](./phase-3.md)
Implement detailed logging, metrics collection, notification systems, and comprehensive audit trails.

### [Phase 4: Enterprise Feature Integration](./phase-4.md)
Add artifact signing, deployment gates, approval workflows, and advanced environment management.

### [Phase 5: Testing & Documentation](./phase-5.md)
Create comprehensive tests for the workflow, documentation, and migration guides.
