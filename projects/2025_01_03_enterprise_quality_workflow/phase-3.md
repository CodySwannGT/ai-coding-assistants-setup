# Phase 3: Performance Optimization

## Objective
Optimize workflow execution time through intelligent caching, parallel execution, and dependency management to achieve at least 30% reduction in total runtime.

## Technical Specifications

### Current Performance Issues
1. Dependencies installed 6+ times across jobs
2. No caching strategy for node_modules
3. Sequential job execution where parallel is possible
4. Redundant operations across jobs
5. No build artifact sharing

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Dependency Caching**
   - Implement node_modules caching
   - Cache npm/yarn/bun package caches
   - Share dependencies across jobs

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Run independent jobs concurrently
   - Optimize job dependencies
   - Use matrix strategies where applicable

3. **Artifact Sharing**
   - Share build outputs between jobs
   - Cache compiled TypeScript files
   - Reuse test results where possible

4. **Smart Skipping**
   - Skip unchanged code paths
   - Use path filters for job triggers
   - Implement incremental testing

## Tasks

### Task 1: Implement Dependency Installation Job
- [ ] Create dedicated job for dependency installation
- [ ] Upload node_modules as artifact
- [ ] Configure cache keys based on lock files
- [ ] Support all package managers (npm, yarn, bun)

```yaml
install_dependencies:
  name: ðŸ“¦ Install Dependencies
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    cache-key: ${{ steps.cache.outputs.cache-key }}
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ inputs.node_version }}
        
    - name: Get cache key
      id: cache
      run: |
        if [ -f "package-lock.json" ]; then
          echo "cache-key=${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        elif [ -f "yarn.lock" ]; then
          echo "cache-key=${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('yarn.lock') }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        elif [ -f "bun.lockb" ]; then
          echo "cache-key=${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('bun.lockb') }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        fi
        
    - name: Cache dependencies
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: |
          ~/.npm
          ~/.yarn/cache
          ~/.bun/install/cache
          node_modules
        key: ${{ steps.cache.outputs.cache-key }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-node-
          
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        # Installation logic for each package manager
        
    - name: Upload node_modules
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: node-modules
        path: node_modules
        retention-days: 1
```

### Task 2: Refactor Jobs to Use Shared Dependencies
- [ ] Modify lint job to download dependencies artifact
- [ ] Update typecheck job to use cached dependencies
- [ ] Adjust test job for dependency reuse
- [ ] Update format job with dependency download
- [ ] Optimize build job with caching

### Task 3: Implement Parallel Job Execution
- [ ] Identify jobs that can run in parallel
- [ ] Create job dependency matrix
- [ ] Implement parallel execution groups
- [ ] Add concurrency controls

```yaml
# Parallel execution strategy
jobs:
  install:
    # Runs first
    
  static_analysis:
    needs: install
    strategy:
      matrix:
        job: [lint, typecheck, format]
    # Runs lint, typecheck, and format in parallel
    
  testing:
    needs: install
    # Runs parallel to static_analysis
    
  security:
    needs: install
    strategy:
      matrix:
        scanner: [npm_audit, snyk, sonarcloud, secret_scan]
    # Runs multiple security scans in parallel
```

### Task 4: Implement Build Artifact Caching
- [ ] Cache TypeScript build outputs
- [ ] Share compiled files between jobs
- [ ] Implement incremental builds
- [ ] Add build artifact validation

### Task 5: Add Smart Job Skipping
- [ ] Implement path-based job triggers
- [ ] Add change detection for relevant files
- [ ] Create skip conditions for unchanged code
- [ ] Add manual override options

```yaml
lint:
  if: |
    contains(inputs.skip_jobs, 'lint') == false &&
    (
      github.event_name != 'pull_request' ||
      contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'skip-lint') == false
    )
```

### Task 6: Create Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Add job timing annotations
- [ ] Create performance dashboard
- [ ] Implement runtime alerts
- [ ] Add optimization recommendations

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Steps
1. Measure baseline workflow execution time
2. Verify dependency caching works across runs
3. Confirm parallel jobs execute correctly
4. Test with various package managers
5. Ensure no race conditions in parallel execution

### Performance Benchmarks
- Target: 30% reduction in total workflow time
- Maximum job runtime: 5 minutes (except build)
- Cache hit rate: >80%
- Parallel efficiency: >70%

### Test Scenarios
```bash
# Scenario 1: Fresh run (no cache)
# Clear all caches and run workflow

# Scenario 2: Cached run
# Run workflow with warm caches

# Scenario 3: Partial changes
# Modify single file and verify smart skipping

# Scenario 4: Dependency update
# Update dependencies and verify cache invalidation
```
