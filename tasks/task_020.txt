# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement AI-enhanced Git Diff Explanation CLI Command
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a 'claude diff-explain' CLI command that provides annotated git diff output, explaining code changes in natural language, highlighting potential issues, and providing context for the changes. This feature should be presented as optional during setup/update with clear user consent required.
# Details:
This task involves creating a new CLI command 'claude diff-explain' that enhances standard git diff output with AI-powered explanations:

1. Extend the existing Claude CLI integration to create a new subcommand 'diff-explain'
2. Implement functionality to capture git diff output for specified files or commits
3. Process the diff output to identify:
   - Added, modified, and deleted code sections
   - Language/framework specific patterns
   - Potential bugs or code smells
   - Security implications of changes
4. Send the processed diff to Claude API with appropriate prompting to:
   - Generate natural language explanations of what changed and why
   - Highlight potential issues or improvements
   - Provide context about the impact of changes
5. Format and display the enhanced diff output with:
   - Original diff syntax highlighting
   - Inline or adjacent natural language explanations
   - Color-coded warnings for potential issues
   - Summary of changes at the file and commit level
6. Implement configuration options:
   - Verbosity level for explanations (brief/detailed)
   - Focus areas (security, performance, readability)
   - Output format preferences (inline, side-by-side, summary-only)
7. Add documentation for the new command in the project README and help text
8. Ensure the implementation handles large diffs efficiently, potentially using chunking or summarization for very large changes
9. Implement as an opt-in feature:
   - Present the feature during setup or update processes with clear description
   - Require explicit user confirmation before enabling
   - Ensure the feature is disabled by default
   - Provide clear instructions on how to enable/disable the feature later
10. Create clear messaging that explains:
    - What data will be sent to Claude API
    - How the diff information will be used
    - Any privacy considerations users should be aware of

The implementation should integrate with the existing Claude CLI architecture and follow the same patterns as previous Git-related features.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should include:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test parsing and processing of git diff output in various formats
   - Test construction of appropriate prompts for Claude API
   - Test formatting and display of enhanced diff output
   - Test configuration options and their effects

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test end-to-end functionality with actual git repositories
   - Test with various types of changes (code, documentation, binary files)
   - Test with different programming languages and frameworks
   - Test with different sizes of diffs (single line to very large changes)
   - Test the opt-in mechanism during setup and updates
   - Verify the feature remains disabled by default

3. Performance Tests:
   - Measure response time for different sizes of diffs
   - Evaluate token usage and API costs for typical usage patterns
   - Test handling of rate limits and large requests

4. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create a test script with predefined git repositories and changes
   - Have developers use the command and provide feedback on:
     - Accuracy of explanations
     - Helpfulness of identified issues
     - Overall UX and readability of output
     - Clarity of opt-in messaging and controls
   - Compare usefulness against standard git diff

5. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test with merge conflicts
   - Test with binary files or non-text content
   - Test with very large repositories or changes
   - Test with unusual or malformed git diff output

6. Command Line Interface Testing:
   - Verify all command options work as expected
   - Test help text and documentation accuracy
   - Test error handling and user feedback
   - Verify opt-in/opt-out functionality works correctly
   - Test that feature state persists correctly between sessions

7. Consent Flow Testing:
   - Verify clear messaging during setup/update
   - Test that explicit confirmation is required
   - Verify that declining doesn't impact other functionality
   - Test the process for enabling/disabling after initial setup

Success criteria: The command successfully processes git diffs, provides accurate and helpful explanations, identifies potential issues, and presents the information in a clear, readable format that developers find more useful than standard git diff output. Additionally, the feature is properly implemented as opt-in with clear user consent required.
