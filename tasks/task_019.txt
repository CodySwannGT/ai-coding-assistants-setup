# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Optional Test-First Development Enforcement
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to detect when new files are added without corresponding test files, prompt users about missing tests, and integrate Claude to suggest appropriate test cases based on the code being developed. Present this as an optional feature during setup/update that requires explicit user opt-in.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a system to enforce test-first development practices as an optional feature:

1. Feature presentation during setup/update:
   - Present the test-first enforcement as an optional feature during installation or update
   - Provide a clear description of what the feature does and its benefits
   - Require explicit user confirmation before enabling (disabled by default)
   - Allow users to enable/disable the feature at any time through configuration

2. File monitoring:
   - Create a mechanism to detect when new source files are added to the project
   - Identify file types that should have corresponding tests (e.g., .js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx)
   - Determine naming conventions for test files (e.g., component.test.js, __tests__/component.js)

3. Test file detection:
   - Implement logic to check if a matching test file exists for newly added source files
   - Support multiple test frameworks (Jest, Playwright, etc.) and their respective file patterns
   - Consider configuration options for custom test file patterns

4. User prompting:
   - Create a notification system to alert developers when tests are missing
   - Implement as a Git hook (pre-commit or post-checkout) to catch missing tests early
   - Make the enforcement optional via configuration settings

5. Claude integration:
   - Develop an interface to send code to Claude for test suggestion
   - Parse the source file to extract relevant information for Claude
   - Format Claude's suggestions into proper test files using the appropriate framework
   - Support multiple testing frameworks (Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests)
   - Include options for test style (e.g., AAA pattern, BDD style)

6. Configuration options:
   - Test framework preferences
   - Enforcement level (strict, warning, disabled)
   - File pattern matching rules
   - Exclusion patterns for files that don't need tests
   - Easy way to disable the feature entirely

7. Documentation:
   - Update user documentation with new feature details
   - Provide examples of configuration options
   - Include troubleshooting guidance
   - Clearly document the opt-in nature of the feature

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test file detection logic with various file patterns and naming conventions
   - Test the configuration parsing and validation
   - Test Claude API integration with mocked responses
   - Test the test file generation logic for different frameworks
   - Test the feature presentation and opt-in mechanism

2. Integration tests:
   - Test the Git hook integration to ensure it triggers appropriately
   - Test the end-to-end flow from file creation to test suggestion
   - Verify configuration options correctly modify behavior
   - Verify the feature remains disabled by default until explicitly enabled

3. Manual testing scenarios:
   - Verify the feature is presented clearly during setup/update
   - Confirm the feature remains disabled until explicitly enabled
   - Create new source files without tests and verify prompts appear only when enabled
   - Test with different configuration settings to ensure enforcement levels work
   - Verify Claude suggestions for different types of components (React components, utility functions, API endpoints)
   - Test with multiple test frameworks to ensure compatibility
   - Verify the feature can be easily disabled after being enabled

4. Edge cases to test:
   - Files that shouldn't require tests (e.g., configuration files)
   - Projects with non-standard directory structures
   - Handling of files with complex dependencies
   - Performance with large codebases
   - Upgrade paths for users who previously had different test enforcement settings

5. User experience testing:
   - Verify the opt-in presentation is clear and non-intrusive
   - Ensure prompts are clear and actionable when the feature is enabled
   - Ensure Claude suggestions are helpful and follow best practices
   - Check that the feature doesn't disrupt normal development workflow

6. Documentation verification:
   - Ensure all configuration options are documented
   - Verify examples work as described
   - Confirm the documentation clearly explains the opt-in nature of the feature
