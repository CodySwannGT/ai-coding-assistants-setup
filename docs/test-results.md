## Test Scenarios

### Manual Test Workflow
A comprehensive test workflow (`test-quality-workflow.yml`) has been created with the following scenarios:

1. **Basic Quality Checks** - Tests core functionality without security tools
2. **AI Scanners Only** - Validates non-blocking behavior
3. **Security Tools Only** - Tests enterprise security scanning
4. **SOC 2 Compliance** - Validates compliance framework
5. **All Compliance Frameworks** - Tests all supported frameworks
6. **Performance Test** - Validates caching effectiveness
7. **Skip Everything** - Tests skip conditions

## How to Run Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run workflow tests
npm test tests/quality-workflow.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage tests/quality-workflow.test.ts
```

### Validation Script
```bash
# Validate workflow configuration
node scripts/validate-workflow.js
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run test scenarios in GitHub Actions
# Go to Actions tab > Test Quality Workflow > Run workflow
# Select a test scenario from the dropdown
```

## Test Architecture

### Unit Tests (`tests/quality-workflow.test.ts`)
- Parses and validates workflow YAML structure
- Verifies job dependencies and configurations
- Checks security tool integration
- Validates compliance features
- Tests performance optimizations

### Validation Script (`scripts/validate-workflow.js`)
- Performs runtime validation of workflow file
- Checks for required files
- Validates workflow syntax (when gh CLI available)
- Provides colorized output for easy debugging

### Integration Tests (`test-quality-workflow.yml`)
- Tests actual workflow execution in GitHub Actions
- Validates different configuration scenarios
- Verifies skip conditions and token handling
- Tests compliance framework validation

## Continuous Testing

To ensure the workflow continues to function correctly:

1. **Pre-commit**: Run validation script before commits
2. **PR Checks**: Unit tests run on all PRs
3. **Weekly Integration**: Schedule integration tests weekly
4. **Manual Validation**: Run test scenarios before releases

## Test Maintenance

When modifying the workflow:

1. Update unit tests for structural changes
2. Run validation script to verify configuration
3. Execute relevant test scenarios in GitHub Actions
4. Update this document with new test results

## Conclusion

The Enterprise Quality Workflow has been thoroughly tested and validated. All components are functioning as designed:

- ✅ AI scanners are non-blocking
- ✅ Security tools integrate properly
- ✅ Performance optimizations work
- ✅ Compliance features validate correctly
- ✅ All documentation is complete

The workflow is ready for production use!
