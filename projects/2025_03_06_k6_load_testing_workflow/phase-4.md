# Phase 4: Integration Patterns and Examples

## Objective
Create comprehensive integration examples showing how customers can incorporate the k6 load testing workflow into their deployment pipelines.

## Technical Specifications

### Integration Patterns
1. **Post-Deployment Testing**: Run after successful deployment
2. **Pre-Production Gate**: Block production deployment on test failure
3. **Scheduled Testing**: Regular performance baseline checks
4. **Manual Trigger**: On-demand performance validation
5. **Multi-Environment**: Progressive testing through environments

### Example Implementations
- AWS deployment integration
- Azure deployment integration
- Kubernetes deployment integration
- Docker-based deployment integration
- Traditional VM deployment integration
